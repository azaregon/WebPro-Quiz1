            Surabaya, also known with it's nickname "City of Heroes," is the capital of Jawa Timur province, Indonesia. Surabaya is the second-largest city in Indonesia with beautiful scenery and has a lot of history behind it. One history that makes Surabaya called "City of Heroes" is the 10th November movement. At that time, the people of Surabaya were attacked by the Britain army because their general, A.W.S Mallaby, died because of a grenade explosion near Jembatan Merah. To remind the next generation about that heroic movement of Surabaya, now, November 10 is celebrated as the Indonesia National Heroes day. Not just that, there is also a university in Indonesia with the name taken from that, it's called "Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember" or ITS.
